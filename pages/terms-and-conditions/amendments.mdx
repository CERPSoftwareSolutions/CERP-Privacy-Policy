# Amendments and Cancellation

    In case of any cancellation by the Client, **CERP** shall not be liable to refund any amounts 
    received towards the order.

    In case of cancellation of project by the client, **CERP** reserves the right to raise an invoice for 
    the amounts as it deems correct (lesser than the total project cost), and the client agrees and 
    is liable to make good such amounts within seven days of such necessary demand/invoice.

    Any amendments, changes proposed or desired by client may incur an additional cost, which 
    shall be undertaken only after client’s acceptance of such an amendment, and the additional 
    cost.

    Once the application has been accepted by the client and has been deployed successfully, 
    any support, which is required by our staff at the client’s premises, which does not form part 
    of the initial scope, shall be charged additionally on an hourly basis.
